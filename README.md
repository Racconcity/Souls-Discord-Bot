# Bagoum Souls
#### Discord bot for Dark Souls.

## Usage
You can add this bot to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=380988051679215616&scope=bot). 

Functionality is simple. You can search up a card by parts of its description (default) or by name, and the bot will return its description.

(Capitalization is for emphasis. The bot ignores capitalization.)

```
-NAME greatsword of artorias
-hunted the darkwraiths
-SEARCH hunted the darkwraiths
```
^These all return Greatsword of Artorias from DS1.

You can limit a search to a specific game by putting ds3, ds2, ds1, or bb in front of the command. Bloodborne support is experimental, let me know if there are problems.

```
-DS3 brigand armor
-DS2 brigand armor
```
^These will return two different Brigand Armors!

You can also request the image of the search object, or a link to wikia for the object. 

```
-IMG friede scythe
-DS1 LINK moonlight greatsword
```

Finally, you can get a random thing using `-random`. You can use `-ds1 random` to get game-specific random things.

There are two administrative commands: `-clean` and `-destroy`. Clean removes the last 50 bot messages, and is granted to server moderators and bot owners. Destroy stops the bot entirely (on all servers), and is only granted to bot owners.
